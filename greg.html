How else will you learn every damn thing known to man, if not here at college? I guess we'll have to use the internet like some kind of animals. I mean, I have never seen someone lay down life and \
limb to learn as much as you do, both academically and personally. It's just as important to you to know the origin of a word as the origin of someone's social anxiety.\
And it's paid off big time. Just look at the ovation you got at the Johnnies. And don't try to remind me of everyone else's applause, this isn't their pala--uh, birthday letter.<br><br>\
You've been a lot of things at Fordham: a great student, actor, technician, researcher, roommate, friend. And I'm excited to live with you next year, not in the least to see what other roles \
you fill beyond Fordham. I do miss the wild conversations that we used to have before senior year hit and everything went haywire. They still come, but they are not often and I am sorry for that.\
I'm sorry I bust your chops so much. It's my way of saying 'Slow down Maurice, you're exhausting yourself.' But it usually comes out as making your life a mini-hell. Sorry \
also for calling our friendship transactional that one time. Not cool. The nice thing about these is that they allow the reader and the writer both some self-indulgence: I get \
to say whatever I want and you don't get to tell me not to worry about it. <br><br> \
Which you inevitably will. Because everyone in your life must be considered and cared about. So make sure you keep some of that love as well, too. You deserve nothing but the best things in life, for all that you put in to giving those to others.\
<br><br>\
John\
<br><br>P.S. A domain is cheaper and (imo) more useful than a card. Use it well.");
